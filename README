The spitool has been born from my growing annoyance when trying to fiddle
with an SPI EEPROM on my bus pirate. Apparently there are no working tools
out there to write an EEPROM, reading only worked after patching a perl
script, verifying/status word access was not there either, etc. As a con-
sequence, this tool is tailored to my needs, and might or might not fit
yours.

Feature overview:

This spitool can
- dump EEPROMs, as hex dump to the display or to a file
- verify (compare) an EEPROM
- write an EEPROM from file (either overwriting fully, or only updating 
  changes)
- wipe an EEPROM (initialize with a constant value)
- read and write the status word
- can run the serial port at extended speeds of 230400, 460800, 1M and 2M baud
- log SPI traffic

Due to some bugfixes the "spifix" branch of firmware 6.2 is recommended, see
http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4340#p42691
This will be needed to drive SPI at clock rates > 2MHz, and for working 
sniffing.

spitool requires popt as only external dependency.
